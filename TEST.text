This is a text file for practicing merging! 

So far i have 3 branches. 
Master: Branch for the release
Develop: Branch for managing developing features
Feature: Branch for managing and creating new features

once the developmenent is finished, the code is merged in to master
Master <= Development

Once the development of a certain feature is done, merge it to development


Master <= Development <= Feature
