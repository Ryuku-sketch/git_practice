This is another textfile. This is not meant to be anything other than 
practicing git....Well, I have read a book about Git, and understood
fundementals of Git. Honestly, I can apply basic commands in practice.
But there is a lot of things that i need to worok on.... In order to deepen
my understanding and skills, the next work will be to pull=>push=>log=>ammend=>
reverse.
